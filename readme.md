# propbank-dict

Builds a macOS dictionary for PropBank.

## Usage

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:seanmacavaney/propbank-dict.git
cd propbank-dict
make
make install
```

**Be sure to clone `--recursive` to get the submodules!**

You may need to open Dictionary preferences and mark the PropBank dictionary before
you can use. (Hint, you can also re-order the dictionary in that window.)
